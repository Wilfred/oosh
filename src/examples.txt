# use cases:
# consider the busy system administrator
# he wants to view, analyse and draw graphs of data from all his systems
# 1) finding a process that's hogging a system -- need a easy sort
oosh_ps | oosh_project User Command 'CPU %' | oosh_sort 'CPU %'
# 2) find which users are using a given shell -- need to join ls and passwd
# 
# 3) find the difference in logs between two systems -- need a convenient
# network abstraction

# 4) wants to plot graphs -- need graphing utilities that structure the data
oosh_ps | oosh_select User wilfred | oosh_graph bar command 'CPU %' snazzy_graph.svg
# 5) wants to execute equally powerful manipulation (grep etc) on the structured
# data as he can with SQL -- need to demonstrate the completeness of our manipulation tools
relational algebra: select, project, rename, product, union, difference
oosh: as above plus sort
# 6) need to be easily extract log data -- needs utilities which understand the
# log structure
oosh_log | oosh_project Daemon Message Time
# 7) needs to find directory hogs -- needs threshold filtering

# 8) wants to discard his old buggy scripts: consider:
ps aux | tail -n +2 | sort -k 3,3 | sed 's/ \+/ /g' | cut -d " " -f 1,3,11- 
# remove header, sort on 2nd column, change to single spaces,
# cut columns 1,3 and 11+
# vs
oosh_ps | oosh_project User Command 'CPU %' | oosh_sort 'CPU %'
# (powershell is very ugly, ps doesn't have CPU % or username)
