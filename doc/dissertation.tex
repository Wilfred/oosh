\section*{Declaration}

I, Wilfred Hughes of Churchill College, being a candidate for Part II
of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation
and the work described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be
specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material
that has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable
purpose.

\chapter{Introduction}

% overview
% why this solution?

\cleardoublepage

\chapter{Preparation}

% investigation -- compared to existing systems
%   -- bash, fish, powershell, osh (Timoth Budd 1989), REPLs
%     -- macro language vs programming language
%   -- bash particularly: lex and parse approach, backwards compat
% requirements (from proposal)
% development approach -- development environment, VCS, backup
%   -- system design -- diagrams of structure!
%   -- different implementation approaches considered
%     -- modify existing work, start from scratch
%     -- similar grammar, readily piped to system below?
% theory?
% summary

\cleardoublepage

\chapter{Implementation}

% architecture
%   -- snazzy pictures!
% what does it do? how? why that way? what inputs? what outputs?

\cleardoublepage

\chapter{Evaluation}

% what was evaluated?
% what were the results?
%   -- no of processes spawned
%   -- length of equivalent bash shells (can use old commands still!)
%   -- network data comparisons (fixed and variable cost increases measured)
%   -- performance
%     -- wall clock time
%     -- memory and CPU usage
% testing/debugging
% comparing against requirements

\cleardoublepage
\chapter{Conclusion}

% aims again
% accomplishments -- likes, dislikes, results
% hindsight thoughts -- better approaches
% future prospects
